# Lu(23)'s implementations

The relication of Lu(23)'s methodology and results is documented in Section 6 of my report.  


## How to run
For each experiment in report's Section 6, you can find a dedicated script.

- `script_onepure.py`: my replication of Lu(23)'s "*One dimensional pure jump process*" experiment.
- `script_robust_M_125_N_20_I_250.py`: one of the "*Robustness*" experiment on Lu(23)'s method across different numbers of trajactories M and time inverval N. Here M=125, N=20, Iteration=250.
- `script_highdim.py`: my replication of Lu(23)'s "*High dimensional problems*" experiment.
